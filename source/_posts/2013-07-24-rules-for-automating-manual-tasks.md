Software developers face a recurring dilemna: Whether it is best to complete a task manually, or to write a script or program to automate it. Rationally, this should come down to questions of "return on investment": How much time will it take to manually perform the task? How long will it take to automate it? How often must the task be completed? The answers to these questions will determine when the automation effort will pay off, and whether it is worth automating at all.

But answering those questions is difficult, and thus so is answering the bigger question: to automate or not to automate. To help with this, I present these four simple and enduring rules for deciding whether to automate manual tasks.

1. You cannot know how long it will take to manually perform a task until you have already done it.
2. You cannot know how long it will take to automate a task until you have already automated it.
3. If you choose to perform a task manually, you will look back at the effort involved and wish you had automated it.
4. If you choose to automate a task, you will look back at the time you spent on the script or program and tell yourself you should have just done it by hand.

Since you will always wish you made the other choice, it does not matter which choice you make. So, one way or another, get it started, then get it done.
